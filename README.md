# GAN Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the implementation and experimentation with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs are a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. They consist of two neural networks, the generator and the discriminator, which compete against each other to create realistic data.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the datasets used for training and testing the GAN models.
- `models/`: Includes the GAN model architectures and their implementations.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and visualization.
    - `GAN_project.ipynb`: Main notebook for the GAN project.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for training and evaluating the GAN models.
- `results/`: Directory to save generated images and model checkpoints.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To train the GAN model, execute the following command:
run the notebook and install requirements.

## Results
Generated images and model performance metrics will be saved in the `results/` directory.
